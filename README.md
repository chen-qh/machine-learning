Codes for some machine learning projects

- Use Support Vector Machine for classification with MNIST data set. Score = 0.9794. [Link](https://github.com/chen-qh/machine-learning/blob/master/mnist%20with%20SVM.ipynb)
- Use Decision Tree to separate two datasets generated by make_moons, accuracy = 0.8545. Build a random forest with 1000 decision trees and improve the accuracy score to 0.858.
