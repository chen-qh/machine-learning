Codes for some machine learning projects

- Use Support Vector Machine for classification with MNIST data set. Score = 0.9794. Link
- Use Decision Tree to separate two datasets generated by make_moons, accuracy = 0.8545. Build a random forest with 1000 decision trees and improve the accuracy score to 0.858. Link
